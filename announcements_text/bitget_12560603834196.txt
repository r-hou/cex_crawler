Introduction Gaia is a decentralized, open-source AI infrastructure that empowers developers to seamlessly create and deploy AI agents across diverse knowledge bases. We envision a transformative shift in the next five years, as the AI agent economy evolves from task-specific tools to autonomous systems capable of managing complex workflows and decentralized processes. These agents will create an interconnected ecosystem, fostering innovation, scalability, and a dynamic digital economy. Gaia aims to become the go-to AI hub for the EVM Ecosystem, with 100+ partnerships, integrations, and agent proof-of-concepts (POCs) in progress. Since its launch, 210,000+ Gaia nodes have been deployed, highlighting Gaiaโs pivotal role in todayโs decentralised AI landscape. Projects like ai16z, Virtuals, and Schizo are built on Gaia, highlighting its growing traction as a leading AI framework. As AI agents proliferate, Gaia has solidified its leadership by providing the scalable, modular, and decentralized infrastructure that developers and protocols trust to drive real adoption and power the future of autonomous systems.
