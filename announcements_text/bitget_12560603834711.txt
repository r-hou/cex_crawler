It is the blockchain for communication. It consists of an EVM-compatible L2 chain, decentralized off-chain stream nodes, and smart contracts deployed on Base. Towns allows people to create programmable communication use cases, referred to as “Spaces,” in a permissionless manner. These Spaces are ownable, accrue value, feature on-chain subscriptions (“Memberships”), an extendable reputation system, and end-to-end message encryption. Space creators generate revenue by selling on-chain memberships. The Towns Protocol accrues value by collecting fees from these membership sales, as well as from trading and tips exchanged between users. Those fees are collected in ETH and used to offset, via programmatic buy and burn, the rewards the protocol emits for node operators. As of July 26th, Towns had over 9117 ETH in gross revenue, and the protocol has collected over 901 ETH in net fees.
