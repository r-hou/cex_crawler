Ibiza Final Boss is a viral internet meme that exploded in popularity in the summer of 2025, featuring a British man named Jack Kay, who was captured in a video dancing energetically at an Ibiza club. Known for his signature look—including a bob haircut, gold chain, black vest, sunglasses, and an LV crossbody bag—along with his intense, foot-shifting dance moves while holding a drink and maintaining a serious expression, Kay quickly became dubbed the "final boss" of Ibiza partying.
