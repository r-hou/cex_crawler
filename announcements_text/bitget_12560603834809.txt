Anyone can contribute compute resources to generate proofs and earn fees, while PROVE is used to reward provers, stake to secure the network, and participate in governance. Succinct makes cryptographic verifiability accessible by enabling developers to write provable programs in familiar languages like Rust using its general-purpose zkVM. By abstracting away ZK complexity, Succinct reduces integration time from months to days. As ZK becomes critical to scalable, secure infrastructure, Succinct aims to be the default verifiability layer for web3 and beyond.
