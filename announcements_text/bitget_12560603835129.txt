To learn more about this project, check out the deep dive on Sidekick. Founded in 2024, Sidekick introduces a model known as LiveFi, which blends livestreamed content with audience participation to make Web3 more engaging and accessible. The team behind Sidekick identified a key gap in Web3: most platforms rely on text-based updates and static interfaces, which makes it difficult to sustain user attention. While livestreaming has become standard in Web2, few products have effectively adapted this format to the Web3 context. Sidekick was built to address this gap by offering a content-first experience where attention is treated as a meaningful asset. It combines real-time interaction, visual communication, incentive-based rewards, and other interactive features to create a more dynamic way for users to learn, discover, and participate in Web3 ecosystems. The platform bridges Web2-style content creation with Web3 infrastructure, adding programmability and reward mechanics to real-time digital participation.
